# Calculator

Basic calculator web app

I decided to make this as a personal project to help develope my JavaScript skills.

This calculator computes multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction in DMAS order. The answer button stores the previous answer, the C button clears the current display on one click, and clears the answer on a second click. The << button serves as a backspace and removes the previously entered value or operator.

Keybindings:
= == "Enter" & "="

ans == "p"

<< == "Backspace"

C == "Escape"

/ == "/"

x == "x" & "\*"

- == "-"

* == "+"

  . == "."

The numbers correspond to the number keys.
